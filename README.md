# RobinsDiscordAssistant

This Software allows you to host your own Discord Bot. Since RDA is based on python language it can easily be used to host a Discord bot on a RaspberryPi.


# Installation

1) First install the discord.py Library

```
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```
If you use Windows and the command python3 canÂ´t be found, try

If this does not work either, you have to add Python 3 to your environment variables.
